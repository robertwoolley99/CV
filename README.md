---------

Energetic full-stack developer seeking new opportunities after graduating from Makers, a bootcamp in London.

I have switched careers to software development as I want to be constantly learning new things, and I also want to my work to have visible results.  I am looking to combine my broader skills with my developing skills in software to make a difference.

I also have extensive experience within transport and the the urban/built environment with nearly 30 years experience in passenger transport, highways.  My functional experience of planning, finance, engineering, marketing and commercial is underpinned by an MBA.

<b>Tech skills:</b> Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, RSpec, Capybara, Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jest, jQuery, Jasmine, PostgreSQL

<b>Analytical</b>

I have very broad experience of problem solving - whether it is looking at identifying cost reduction opportunities, new commercial opportunities, or developing effective reporting.  Makers has let me take this to the tech sphere where I've had the challenge of being thrown in at the deep end - and learnt how to identify solutions to problems, then build them.

<b>Communication</b>

Previous roles involved working with diverse stakeholders - in terms of professional backgrounds (finance, marketing, planning, commercial, technical) as well as ethnically diverse backgrounds (including a period working abroad).  In order to operate effectively I have had to develop the ability to explain quite complex issues in a manner which is suitable for the relevant audience.  This has included drafting materials for use by the public.

<b>Project Management</b>

Project Management experience has been at both the micro level (identifying and then leading cost reduction opportunities) as well at the macro  level - managing the PMO for the London Low Emission Zone.  I also edited the project controls materials for a Saudi infrastructure organisation, working to subject matter experts within a British projects consultancy.

## <a name="Education"></a>Education
### Makers Academy (October 2019 to January 2020)
Europe's leading programming bootcamp, teaching good practices as well as coding skills:
* Curiosity and passion for code
* Commitment to best practices and delivering watertight code
* Independent learner and problem-solver
* XP, TDD, Agile, pair programming

### Cranfield University (January 2004 to December 2005)
* Master of Business Administration
* Gained part-time whilst working full-time at London Underground Ltd
* Dissertation focussed on Escalation of Commitment in Decision-Making - working title was "Why is it so hard to kill bad projects?" (Answer: getting stuck in entrenched positions).

### Loughborough University (October 1989 to June 1993)
* BSc(Hons) Transport Management & Planning
* Industrial placement year with WS Atkins working on traffic modelling projects during 1991-2.
* Loughborough had an enlightened policy regarding undergraduate access to IT resources - resulting in me spending far too much time playing around on the university's HP-UX minicomputer gaining knowledge of UNIX, and the pre-Web Internet.  I also got exposed to FORTRAN77... (I still prefer Sinclair Basic - learnt on a ZX81 and a ZX Spectrum).

## <a name="Experience"></a> Experience.
I worked in a broad range of functions within transport and construction between 1991 and 2019.  This included:  

* Using analytical skills in engineering - basic traffic and road safety engineering at Acer Consultants Ltd between 1993 and 1995.   
* Planning, managing and organising when working in policy development and preparation of bidding documents at Hertfordshire County Council and London Transport Buses between 1995 and 2003 along with some research - I worked on the prototype cashless bus route in London in 2001.  
* Developing my people skills by providing advice and support to project managers developing business cases for their projects as well as undertaking investment appraisal at London Underground Ltd between 2004 and 2006.   
* Further developed project management skills by managing a PMO for the London Low Emission Zone at Transport for London's Congestion Charging Division between 2006 and 2007.   
* Using analytical skills in finance by investigating and developing means to cut costs, as well as providing oversight to Directors with TfL's finance division between 2007 and 2011.   
* Developed commercial skills by identifying and implementing income opportunities from commercial telecoms activities at TfL between 2012 and 2017, leading an ethnically and professionally diverse team.
* Used domain knowledge to prepare the marketing plans for launch of the Riyadh Public Transport Network for the Riyadh Development Authority in 2017 and 2018.   
* Developed analytical skills by supporting a project controls audit and then acting as technical editor for a British consultancy in Saudi Arabia in 2019; the end client is a leading Saudi infrastructure organisation.
